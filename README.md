Code Explanation
The Budget Tracker is implemented using object-oriented programming principles in Python. Here's a breakdown of the main components and their functionalities:
BudgetTracker Class
This class serves as the core of the application, containing methods for managing income, expenses, and generating budget overviews.
__init__(self): Initializes the BudgetTracker object with empty lists and sets for storing financial data.
add_income(self, amount): Adds income to the tracker. It includes error handling to ensure the input is a positive number.
add_expense(self, description, amount, category): Adds an expense to the tracker. It stores the expense details in a dictionary and adds the category to the set of categories.
get_total_expenses(self): Calculates and returns the sum of all expenses.
get_remaining_budget(self): Calculates and returns the difference between total income and total expenses.
get_expenses_by_category(self): Groups and sums expenses by category, returning a dictionary of category totals.
display_budget_overview(self): Prints a formatted overview of the current budget state, including total income, total expenses, remaining budget, and expenses by category.
Main Function
The main() function serves as the entry point for the application and handles user interaction through a simple menu system.
It creates an instance of the BudgetTracker class.
It enters a loop that displays a menu and processes user choices until the user chooses to exit.
Based on the user's choice, it calls the appropriate methods of the BudgetTracker instance.
The main loop handles four options:
Add Income
Add Expense
View Budget Overview
Exit
Error handling is implemented to catch invalid inputs and provide user-friendly error messages.
